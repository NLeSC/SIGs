# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

A **Special Interest Group** is a knowledge hub for a set of expertise areas. It is ideal for eScience Research Engineers share lessons learned, best practices, ideas, but most important, learn and stay up-to-date about the state-of-the-art in technical areas. As a hub for knowledge, it becomes the central point on technology consultancy for internal projects. Knowledge dissemination is done through monthly meetups, but also workshops, hackathons, tutorials, etc. The latter are used to exchange knowledge with outside world.

## SGIs Governance
SIGs are under TechLeads responsibility. They decide which SIGs should exist, which ones need to be active and supervise their activity. Their content management and execution are delegated to a team of two or three eScience Research Engineers. A SIG team is responsible for the logistics, define the content, lead the sessions, and report to the TechLeads.

A SIG team is set by the TechLeads at the SIG creation or re-activation. The creation and the re-activation of a SIG is done in reaction to a TechLeads' decision, a request by the Management Team, or a suggestion by a group of eScience Research Engineers. A SIG remains active while there is knowledge dissemation and consultancy needs for one of its expertise areas.
SIGâ€™s content is never destroyed since it is considered part of the Netherlands eScience Center knowledge base. Hence, when a SIG is not anymore relevant, it is deactivated. The decision to deactivate a SIG is done by the TechLeads. 

## SIG Setup
A new SIG must have at least an office group and GitHub repository. The former is mainly for communication (via a mailing list) while the latter is used as a knowledge base and SIG's management. For private documents, they should be stored in One-drive with read/write permission set for the SIG's office group. It allows the link for the document be shared as content in a public GitHub repository, but with restricted read and write access.

Once an office group and a GitHub repository are set, the TechLeads will announce the SIG to all employees of the Netherlands eScience Center so the interested ones can subscribe to the group mailing list. After the announcement, all communication is done via SIG's mailing list and controlled by the SIG's team.
