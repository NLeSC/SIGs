# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

A **Special Interest Group** is a knowledge hub for a set of expertise areas. It is ideal for eScience Research Engineers share lessons learned, best practices, ideas, but most important, learn and stay up-to-date about the state-of-the-art in technical areas. As a hub for knowledge, it becomes the central point on technology consultancy for internal projects. Knowledge dissemination is done through monthly meetups, but also workshops, hackathons, tutorials, etc. The latter are used to exchange knowledge with outside world.

## SGIs Governance
SIGs are under TechLeads responsability. They decide which SIGs should exist, which ones need to be active and supervise their activity.
Their content management and execution is delegated to a team of two or three eScience Research Engineers. A SIG team is responsible for the logistics, define the content, lead the sessions, and report to the TechLeads.

A SIG team is defined by the TechLeads at the moment a SIG is either created or re-activated. The creation and the re-activation of a SIG is done in reaction to a TechLeads' decision, a request by the Management Team, or a suggestion by a group of eScience Research Engineers.

## New SIG
A new SIG needs to at least have a mailling list and GitHub repository. The former is mainly for communication while the later is used as a knowledge base and their management.
